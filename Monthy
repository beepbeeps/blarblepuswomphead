/*OpenOffice 1.	The following algorithm yields the season (Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter) for a given month and day. (25 points)
If month is 1, 2, or 3, season = Winter
Else if month is 4, 5, or 6, season = Spring
Else if month is 7, 8, or 9, season = Summer
Else if month is 10, 11, or 12, season   Fall
If month is divisible by 3 and day >= 21
    If season is Winter, season = Spring
    Else if season is Spring, season = Summer
    Else if season is Summer, season = Fall
    Else season = Winter
Write a program that prompts the user for a month and day and then prints the season, as determined by this algorithm.
